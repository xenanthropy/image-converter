# image-converter
GTK image converter program written in Ruby (powered by rmagick library)

A simple GTK program that I wrote to easily convert images to other formats
(I got tired of using online converters to convert those pesky .webp files into pngs)

Just choose an image file, select the filetype you'd like to convert to, select a save location, and click convert!

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

requires the 'gtk3' and 'rmagick' ruby libraries, as well as having imagemagick installed.  
You can get the libraries by running  
```gem install gtk3``` and
```gem install rmagick```  
and installing imagemagick through your distro's software repository/package manager
