# image-converter
GTK image converter program written in Ruby (powered by rmagick library)

A simple GTK program that I wrote to easily convert images to other formats
(I got tired of using online converters to convert those pesky .webp files into pngs)

Just choose an image file, select the filetype you'd like to convert to, select a save location, and click convert!
